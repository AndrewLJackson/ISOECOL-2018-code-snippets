This script is a first attempt to build a dynamic movement model to reconstruct the movement of an organisms around its isoscape environment.

Here I will simulate an animal moving around the "isoscape" that is the volcano dataset.

```{r simulate-movement}

data(volcano)

isoscape <- volcano
rm(volcano)

set.seed(1)

# starting cell
start <- c(30, 25)




```
