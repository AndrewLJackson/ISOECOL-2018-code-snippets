Ideas for the modelling framework / roadmap paper proposed by Clive at ISOECOL2018.

Incoporation processes to consider:

- growth rate
- body mass (where on the growth curve are you - also see growth rate above)
- what tissue is being built? (where are isotopes getting routed)
  - fat
  - muscle
  - gonads
- stoichiometry of food (probably waaaay too complex)

Dynamic models Pecquarie et al DEB model.

Can we model an individual as a simple block of muscle and fat and allow it to grow via incorporation?
